1. When we search "Calories in apple" vs "Turnover of apple" , it is funny how Google knows that which apple I am talking about whether it is a fruit or the company. It is done by basically Semantic search, that is we don't just search just by the exact match but rather by understanding the search. 

2. We use Vector Database for this reason that we give some kindof points to the search and the croterias based on which we will scheme through while searching for a query and there is a hashing technology which is used which divides the data into buckets and when we search we search in a specific bucket rather than the whole DB and we search for the vector which matches more with the actual query rather than the exact match.
